    <h2>A Tale of Two Lineups</h2>
    <p>
      The chart below reveals the stark contrast in Juan Sotoâ€™s performance. In late 2024, with Aaron Judge behind him in the Yankees lineup (blue line), Sotoâ€™s 10-game rolling hit average soared. In early 2025, with the Mets and no Judge (orange line), it plummeted.

    <h2>What It Means</h2>
    <p>
      This isnâ€™t about Soto losing his skillâ€”itâ€™s about strategy. With Judge on deck, pitchers threw more strikes, giving Soto better pitches to hit. Without Judge, pitchers could afford to be cautious, dodging Soto with walks or off-speed pitches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The graph screams one truth: lineup protection matters. The Sotoâ€“Judge Effect is real, and itâ€™s measurable.
