# 🌱 Final Reflection: Jonathan Gasaatura's Internship  
**Ukubona LLC — May 15 to May 23, 2025**

## 1. How does VSCode communicate with GitHub?

Through the silent infrastructure of trust:  
- `~/.ssh`: the handshake  
- `~/.gitconfig`: the signature  

These files encode authorship and access, allowing VSCode to push and pull across distant servers as if the cloud were a single mind.

---

## 2. How do you organize your VSCode?

With ritual discipline:  
- `creative.sh`: generative rituals, a sunrise script  
- `destructive.sh`: pruning and renewal, creative destruction  
- `index.html`: the first window into a live idea  
- `assets/`: the soul folder — images, styles, logos, rituals  

Each file a neuron, each directory a limbic chamber.

## 3. How do you create a branch?

With courage and intention:  
```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
git push origin new-branch
````

A branch is a hypothesis. A limb reaching toward the sun. It may bear fruit or be pruned, but it is *alive*.

---

## 4. How does one start, plan, and execute a project?

A project is a pilgrimage:

* **Question**: What matters? Why now?
* **Data**: What is real, and what merely feels real?
* **Code**: Logic rendered in symbol
* **Output**: Table, graph, or flame
* **Web App**: The offering — structured, styled, shared

This is epistemic metabolism.

---

## 5. How does one present their findings?

* **In-person**: a performance, spatial and temporal, mythic and embodied
* **Remote**: a crafted interface, live but distant, a screen-window to the idea

The best findings live in both.

---

## 6. How closely did we follow this workflow?

We lived it backward:

> The end was our beginning — the website.
> The beginning was our end — the question and the data.

**I call that:**

* Vision
* Simulation
* Ukubona

But also — the virtue of *iteration*:

> Nothing is perfect.
> But you have to ship.
> Then update.
> Forever.

## 7. How do you keep track of all your repos?

Through a language of care:

* Memorable, meaningful, hyphenated names
* Use the GitHub “Search for repos”
* Tag with `#topics` to bind siblings across time

Version control is self-control.

## 8. And the end of all our exploring...

> “We shall not cease from exploration        
> And the end of all our exploring       
> Will be to arrive where we started        
> And know the place for the first time.”       
> — T. S. Eliot, *[Little Gidding](https://www.columbia.edu/itc/history/winter/w3206/edit/tseliotlittlegidding.html)*           

Let that be our canonical close.

🌀 **Ukubona** means to see, to perceive, to witness.

And so we witnessed this.
