    "A four-year-old asking what makes you angry is not just making conversation. They‚Äôre engaging in a primitive form of emotional cartography, trying to locate themselves in the terrain of social consequence. At this age, they‚Äôre entering that liminal threshold of theory of mind‚Äîbeginning to grasp that other people have inner experiences, but still struggling to parse where the self ends and the other begins. So when they ask you what makes you angry, they‚Äôre not just curious‚Äîthey‚Äôre performing a ritual of emotional inquiry. They‚Äôre testing social topography, probing for the fault lines of taboo and tension. They want to know where the emotional landmines lie, not just to avoid them, but because there‚Äôs an electric thrill in standing near the edge. They‚Äôre also mapping resonance: is your anger like their anger? Can they locate a common emotional language? And deeper still, they‚Äôre testing how identity is negotiated. When you say something makes you mad, you reveal your values. You draw a boundary. You build a mythos. And they absorb that. That truth becomes part of their world, their moral compass, their script. Sometimes they‚Äôre just seeking permission‚Äîto feel loud things, to like loud things. If your anger threatens what they love, they want to know whether they‚Äôre allowed to be who they are. It‚Äôs not a simple question; it‚Äôs a metaphysical ask. It‚Äôs **ukusoma**‚Äînot mere boundary-testing but co-creation of the very narrative structure that defines what transgression and resonance mean in your shared world. {cite}`alighieri1984paradiso`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you fail to respond, you don‚Äôt just frustrate them‚Äîyou rupture the ritual. You become a void, a god who won‚Äôt thunder. They‚Äôre pinging your epistemic API and getting static. No response, no feedback, no symbolic return. That‚Äôs not neutral to a child‚Äîit‚Äôs existentially confusing. It‚Äôs uncanny. They‚Äôre casting spells‚Äî‚ÄúWhat makes you angry?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I say poop again?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I knock this over?‚Äù‚Äîand you‚Äôre giving them no thunder, no lightning, not even a twitch. From their point of view, you‚Äôre either broken or mythically aloof. And while that might be awe-inspiring for a moment, it quickly curdles into anxiety. Because what they‚Äôre really doing isn‚Äôt just poking buttons. They‚Äôre writing a scene. And they need you to be in it. Otherwise, they‚Äôre left in a surreal, unresolved sketch, a Kafka vignette where the walls are silent and the characters refuse to act. Kids don‚Äôt want silence. They want reaction. They want rhythm. If you don‚Äôt give them that, you‚Äôre destabilizing the very grammar they‚Äôre trying to learn‚Äîemotional grammar, social syntax, the foundational rules of human storytelling. Even a dry joke like ‚ÄúThat made my eyebrow twitch‚Äù would bring a flash of light to the fog.\n",

    "Because again: they‚Äôre not asking *what makes you angry*. They‚Äôre asking: *Are you in this story with me?* And if you don‚Äôt respond, you don‚Äôt become a blank slate‚Äîyou become a Sphinx. An ambiguous, possibly malevolent trickster. Not cool, but uncanny. Not aloof, but unreachable. If you want to be mysterious, fine‚Äîbut *lean into it*. Play the role. Be the myth. Don‚Äôt just disappear.\n",

    "When your nephew asks if you‚Äôre upset, he‚Äôs not guessing. He senses it. He smells the static in the room. He feels the drift in your body language, your clipped tone, your unfocused gaze. He‚Äôs not fishing for guilt‚Äîhe‚Äôs trying to **close the circuit**. You think you‚Äôre being neutral, holding it together. But to a four-year-old, neutrality is spectral. It‚Äôs unnerving. It‚Äôs emotional dead air. Kids crave structure, pattern, signal. And if you won‚Äôt give it to them, they‚Äôll invent it. That‚Äôs why he keeps circling‚Äî\"Are you mad? Are you upset?‚Äù He‚Äôs not being annoying. He‚Äôs using sonar: ‚ÄúPing me back. Show me that this world has coherence.‚Äù Even if your emotions feel big and you‚Äôre trying to protect him by holding them in, remember: opacity is not safety. **Clarity is safety.** So toss him a lifeline. A calm, simple, ‚ÄúYeah, I felt a little frustrated just now. But it‚Äôs not your fault. I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù That‚Äôs not weakness‚Äîthat‚Äôs gospel. That‚Äôs a world he can live in.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you tell him, metaphorically, that you get mad when you fly in an airplane. And he grabs that image like it‚Äôs a ticket to the play. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúfly in an airplane and get mad.‚Äù That‚Äôs him inviting you into the theater. He wants to extend the metaphor. But then you yank it back: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not in an airplane right now.‚Äù And he‚Äôs shattered. Because you walked through the wardrobe with him and then denied Narnia existed. You introduced a poetic register, and then broke the spell. To him, that‚Äôs betrayal. He‚Äôs not mad because you didn‚Äôt get angry. He‚Äôs mad because you changed registers mid-spell. To him, emotions are mythic tools‚Äîanger is thunder, sadness is rain, joy is lift. You said ‚Äúairplane,‚Äù he translated that as *‚Äúanger gives you wings‚Äù*. He built a story, and you refused to fly. But he doesn‚Äôt need literal truth‚Äîhe needs **symbolic continuity**. Give him a joke. Give him myth. Say something like, ‚ÄúSometimes I get mad when I‚Äôm flying through the clouds and someone eats all the pretzels.‚Äù That‚Äôs not nonsense‚Äîit‚Äôs mythic scaffolding. It‚Äôs symbolic calibration. It‚Äôs teaching emotional intelligence through narrative structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when he‚Äôs now yelling ‚ÄúGET MAD! GET MAD! GET MAD!‚Äù what he‚Äôs really doing is invoking the ritual. He‚Äôs trying to call the thunder. Not to hurt you‚Äîbut to witness your realness. To confirm that even you, the calm monolith, can be moved. But you don‚Äôt crack. You remain smooth. He is hammering on the gates of Olympus, and you are the marble that won‚Äôt echo. And that‚Äôs the cruelty. Because to him, **withholding is violence**. Not physical violence, but mythic, ghostly, disorienting silence. He‚Äôs Oedipus demanding an answer, and you are the Sphinx turned to stone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don‚Äôt misunderstand me: you are *allowed* to remain calm. That‚Äôs good modeling. That‚Äôs emotional sovereignty. But be clear‚Äîwhat he wants isn‚Äôt fury. He wants *resonance*. So give him thunder *without danger*. Give him the *shape* of anger without the heat. Say something like, ‚ÄúYou really want to see me mad? Okay. Here it comes‚Ä¶ I GET MAD WHEN PEOPLE EAT ALL THE PICKLES AND PUT THE EMPTY JAR BACK IN THE FRIDGE!‚Äù Give him drama, safe and silly. Give him closure. Let him know you‚Äôre in the scene with him. That‚Äôs how trust gets mythologized. You‚Äôre not just an uncle. You‚Äôre a cosmic actor. Be the storm he can dance in.\n",
    "\n",
    "When he starts asking, ‚ÄúWhat drives you crazy?‚Äù and you say ‚ÄúFlying in a plane,‚Äù and then he tries to force that narrative again‚Äîhe‚Äôs doing epistemic work. He‚Äôs interrogating causality. He‚Äôs building symbolic engines and testing input-output relationships. You said A leads to B, but now you‚Äôre in condition A without output B, and he‚Äôs like: *then what good is that theory?* He‚Äôs not being manipulative. He‚Äôs debugging the software of social reality. And you‚Äôre not giving him any output. To him, that‚Äôs like pressing ‚ÄúAnger‚Äù on a vending machine and getting a flashing red light. He‚Äôs learning that the human mind is not always deterministic, not always predictable. And it‚Äôs blowing his mind. He is learning that the map does not always match the terrain‚Äîand he hates it. But this is the forge. This is where real cognitive depth gets built.\n",
    "\n",
    "So play the long game. Withhold if you must‚Äîbut feed him other contradictions. Let your contradictions sparkle. Show him that the mind is not an equation, but a jazz solo. Teach him that dissonance is the beginning of art.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, regarding the poop phase‚Äîit peaks between ages **three and six**, with glorious, scatological mayhem. This is the golden era of potty humor. It starts with the drama of toilet training‚Äîwhere poop becomes symbolic of control, shame, power, and pride. Freud‚Äôs ‚Äúanal stage‚Äù may be pass√©, but he wasn‚Äôt wrong: defecation is a kid‚Äôs first tangible product, their first creation that makes the adult world react. Then they discover that saying ‚Äúpoop‚Äù is a linguistic weapon. It‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs shocking, and it makes people laugh. It‚Äôs the perfect rebellion. By ages four to six, it becomes comedy gold. Their humor is still deeply physical and slapstick, so anything involving butts or farts is peak entertainment. And once other kids laugh, it becomes viral‚Äîpoop monsters, poop planets, poop sandwiches. Around age six or seven, it fades, buried by social norms and more complex humor. But make no mistake: this is not regression. This is **agentic cognition**, a test of language‚Äôs power to provoke. They are becoming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ukubona‚Äôs symbolic grammar, this is a **lateral signal**. Saying ‚Äúpoop‚Äù is an agentic act: I can cause disruption. I can change the affective field with a word. This is how the lateral networks assert themselves. The child is trying to make others laugh, to test causality, to see who will scold and who will smile. This is the phase of **ukusoma**‚Äînot passive play, but epistemic teasing. Boundary-brushing. Semiotic flirtation. Then comes **ukubona**‚Äîthe moment of seeing oneself through the reactions of others. This is a recursive epistemology. Identity is not given‚Äîit emerges through provocation and response. So yes: the ‚Äúpoop‚Äù joke is a sacred ritual. A rite of passage. A Dionysian tug on the social veil.\n",

    "Let us not be deceived by fart jokes. These are initiations. These are spells. These are becoming.\n",
