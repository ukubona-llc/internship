That's an interesting statement about criteria for valid concepts and distinctions. It suggests a view where only concepts that can be clearly observed without ambiguity should be accepted or considered legitimate.

This position connects to several philosophical traditions:

- It resembles aspects of logical positivism, which emphasized verifiability through observation
- It aligns with certain empiricist approaches that prioritize sensory experience
- It shares elements with operationalism, which requires concepts to be defined through specific measurement procedures

However, this criterion raises several questions worth exploring:

1. What counts as "unambiguous observation"? Even seemingly straightforward observations can involve interpretation.

2. How does this view handle theoretical concepts in science that aren't directly observable but are inferred from their effects (like electrons, gravity, or natural selection)?

3. What about subjective experiences or phenomenological concepts that are directly experienced but not publicly observable?

4. Does this position potentially limit our conceptual frameworks in ways that might hinder understanding?

Would you like to explore any of these aspects further? Or perhaps clarify what you mean by concepts being "admissible" and "unambiguously observed"?
