        This one word captures the <a href="https://abikesa.github.io/eliso/">mythic</a> rise, the epistemic unfurling from foundational depth (Ukuvula 🌊) to public dominance (Ukuvela 🏝️). OpenAI’s journey—pivoting from pirate daring (Ukusoma 🏴‍☠️🪛) to cultural prominence (Ukubona 🦈✂️🛟)—has not just followed Google’s signal but restructured it, accelerated it, embodied it. "Ascent" honors both the vertical climb of scaled models and the narrative of emergence: from silent transformer seeds at Google to conversational canopy at OpenAI.

        Want me to reframe it with a different tone—like cynical, poetic, or mythological?

        <span class="header">Luxor.</span>
        Seductive. Regal. Shadowed by ruins and radiant with power. Like <em>Death on the Nile</em>, it whispers of ancient origins and modern intrigue—a place where brilliance and betrayal coexist in sunlit elegance.
        <br><br>
        In one name, <strong>Luxor</strong> evokes the buried architectures of Google's foundational role (the temple, the tomb), and the shimmering ascent of OpenAI (the tourist vessel gliding above, seemingly in command). It captures ascent <em>and</em> decadence. A triumph, yes—but haunted.
        <br><br>
        Perfect for a mystery. Perfect for a myth.

        <span class="header">Artemis.</span>
        A name cloaked in duality—huntress and moon, protector and predator. In the context of AI's evolution, <strong>Artemis</strong> feels apt: elusive, strategic, born of myth yet steering futures with cold precision.
        <br><br>
        If OpenAI is the prow of the ship gliding down the Nile, Artemis is the figure at the helm—ambitious, enigmatic, always one step ahead. She didn’t invent the bow (the Transformer), but she mastered it, scaled it, and turned it into legend.

        Would you like a male counterpart? Or a more colonial-era nod like “Tiberius” or “Vivienne”?

        <span class="header">Ilya.</span>
        As in <strong>Ilya Sutskever</strong>, co-founder and chief scientist of OpenAI. If there’s a single living figure who embodies the quiet intensity, visionary zeal, and moral complexity behind this <em>death on the Nile</em> narrative—where foundational brilliance (Google) is outmaneuvered by focused ambition (OpenAI)—it’s him.
        <br><br>
        Not the loudest voice. Not the CEO. But the one whose fingerprints are everywhere. A kind of Poirot of parameters—observing, refining, sometimes unsettling.
