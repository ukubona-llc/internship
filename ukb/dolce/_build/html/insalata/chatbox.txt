Five things:
1. I'm building my personal wiki 
2. Goal is 99% fidelity to wiki aesthetics 
3. Platform will be transferrable through variants to other sorts 
   - Mywiki
   - Familywiki
   - Ukubonawiki
4. For now, help guide us there by mapping the .md content below onto the .html content
5. Any questions? Here is the directory structure
   - Let me know if you wish to see any of the .css & .js content 
   - Should not be conversational although what I share is (wiki isn't conversational)
   - Authoritative is what we need!
