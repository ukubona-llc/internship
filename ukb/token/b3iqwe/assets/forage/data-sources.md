To rigorously analyze Juan Soto's performance before and after Aaron Judge's absence, you'll need detailed game-level data. Here's how you can obtain and prepare this data:

---

### üìä **1. Obtain Game Logs**

**A. Baseball-Reference**

* Navigate to Juan Soto's player page: [Juan Soto on Baseball-Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sotoju01.shtml).
* Scroll down to the "Game Logs" section.
* Select the desired season (e.g., 2024 or 2025).
* Click on the "Batting Game Logs" link for that season.
* Use the "Export" option to download the data as a CSV file.([FanGraphs Baseball][1])

**B. FanGraphs**

* Visit Juan Soto's game log page: [Juan Soto Game Logs on FanGraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/juan-soto/20123/game-log?position=OF&season=).
* Select the appropriate season from the dropdown menu.
* Use the "Export Data" button to download the game logs in CSV format.([FanGraphs Baseball][1])

### üõ†Ô∏è **2. Prepare the Data**

* After downloading, open the CSV files using a spreadsheet program or a Python script.
* Filter the data to focus on the specific date ranges:

  * **Late 2024**: Identify games where Aaron Judge was active.
  * **Early 2025**: Identify games where Aaron Judge was absent.
* Create two separate datasets: one for games with Judge in the lineup and one without.

---

### üìà **3. Analyze and Visualize**

* Use Python libraries like `pandas` and `matplotlib` to compute rolling averages (e.g., 10-game rolling OBP or batting average).
* Plot these metrics over time to visualize any performance shifts.
* Save the plots as `.jpeg` files for inclusion on Jonathan's website.([baseballsavant.com][2])

### üîç **4. Consider Advanced Metrics**

For a more in-depth analysis:

* **Statcast Data**: Use [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) to access advanced metrics like exit velocity, launch angle, and pitch types.
* **Pitch Type Analysis**: Determine if pitchers altered their approach to Soto in Judge's absence (e.g., increased off-speed pitches).([baseballsavant.com][2])

By following these steps, you'll equip Jonathan with the necessary data and tools to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Juan Soto's performance relative to Aaron Judge's presence in the lineup.
