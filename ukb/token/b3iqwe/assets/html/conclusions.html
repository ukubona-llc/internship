    <h2>A Game of Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      The Sotoâ€“Judge Effect isnâ€™t just about one playerâ€™s performanceâ€”itâ€™s about the chess game of baseball. Juan Sotoâ€™s hits surged with Aaron Judge behind him because pitchers were forced to play fair. Without Judge, they could dodge, weave, and walk Soto at will.

      Figure: The Sotoâ€“Judge Effect in actionâ€”hits soar with Judge (blue), dip without him (orange).
    </p>
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lineup Protection Matters:</strong> A feared hitter like Judge forces pitchers to engage the batter before them, boosting performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Tells the Story:</strong> Statcast data and rolling averages reveal clear trendsâ€”Sotoâ€™s 2024 success wasnâ€™t luck; it was strategy.</li>
      <li><strong>Implications for Teams:</strong> Building a lineup isnâ€™t just about starsâ€”itâ€™s about how they fit together. The right formation can amplify talent.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why It Resonates</h2>
    <p>
      This analysis shows that baseball is more than raw talentâ€”itâ€™s a game of systems, strategy, and synergy. The Sotoâ€“Judge Effect is a reminder: even the best players need the right environment to shine.
