  <h1>Ukubona Internship Summary: ukb-i-002</h1>
  <p><strong>Intern:</strong> ukb-i-002 (Paul)</p>
  <p><strong>Session Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>Paul was onboarded with a fully interactive tutorial. He began by creating a GitHub account and repository, followed by crafting his first <code>index.html</code> and deploying it via GitHub Pages. This allowed him to see his first "Hello World" webpage live.</p>
  <p>He then explored GitHub Codespaces. Inside the online editor, he created a <code>link.html</code> file using <code>nano</code>, practiced the Control+X, Y, Enter save sequence, and added a hyperlink to it from <code>index.html</code>. We walked through <code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code>, and <code>git push</code> to publish his changes. He was able to verify these on the live GitHub Pages site.</p>
  <p>Finally, we transitioned to a live demo from the mentor’s local VS Code environment, showing a full local-to-remote publishing workflow. This gave him a sense of the complete toolchain.</p>
  <h2>Next Step</h2>
  <p>Paul has now been dispatched to Week 1 onboarding: installing VS Code and replicating the environment on his own Windows system.</p>
