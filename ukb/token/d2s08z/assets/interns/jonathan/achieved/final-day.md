## 🔥 Reset + Rebuild (Creative-Destruction Method)

### Run this to clear and reinstall:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abikesa/creative-destruction/refs/heads/main/destructive.sh | bash
```

### Then install Xcode & Homebrew:

xcode-select --install
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

---

### Run the Creative Setup

```

### VS Code Setup & Git Config

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"' >> ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zprofile
code --version

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abikesa/creative-destruction/refs/heads/main/setup-vscode.sh | bash

nano ~/.gitconfig
# Add your name + email
```

### Run the Automated Python Setup

```bash
bash setup/setup.sh
# (this creates your `myenv`, installs packages, and gets you coding)
```

## 🚀 Final Advice

> *“A shipped story is always better than a perfect draft.”*
> Your site, chart, and GitHub history now show that you can **ask a question**, **test a hypothesis**, and **publish a data-driven answer**. That’s elite-level for any intern, let alone a high school senior.

Keep this `.md` forever.
