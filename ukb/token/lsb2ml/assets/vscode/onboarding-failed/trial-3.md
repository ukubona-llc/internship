Here’s your **intern-ready printed card** for setting up **SSH-based GitHub access**. This is clean, minimal, and brutalist—designed for zero ambiguity and no mental overhead. Print it, screenshot it, slap it into your training repo, or tape it to the damn wall.

## 🚀 GitHub SSH Setup – Intern Cheat Sheet

**Objective**: Clone, commit, and push *without* passwords, tokens, or bullshit.

---

### ✅ ONE-TIME SETUP (Intern's Mac)

#### 1. 🎯 Generate SSH Key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "intern@example.com"
```

* Press Enter 3x (accept defaults)
* Key saved in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

---

#### 2. 📋 Copy the Public Key

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

* Copy the full key (starts with `ssh-ed25519`)
* Go to: [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)
* Click **"New SSH Key"**

  * Title: `MacBook` or `Intern Laptop`
  * Paste the key, click **Add SSH key**

---

#### 3. ✅ Test Authentication

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

> If it says:
> “Hi intern123! You’ve successfully authenticated...”
> You're done.

---

### 💻 Daily Use

#### 🔽 Clone a Repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/your-repo.git
```

No token. No password. Just clones.

---

#### ✍️ Make Changes

```bash
# Edit files in VS Code or Terminal
```

---

#### 📦 Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Intern: my first change"
git push
```

Done. Repo updated.

---

### 🧠 Intern Tips

* You’ll never see a password prompt again. If you do, you’re using the wrong URL.
* Always clone with SSH: starts with `git@github.com:...`, not `https://`.
* If stuck: run `ssh -T git@github.com` to confirm SSH is working.

---

### 🧼 Reset SSH Key (if needed)

```bash
rm ~/.ssh/id_ed25519*
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "intern@example.com"
```

Then re-add the key on GitHub.
