    "**_Narrative is Overrated_**. Narrative is a backward-looking filter. A compression algorithm applied after the event. It is not the code of emergence but its shadow—consonance imposed where dissonance once reigned. We pretend that stories explain motion, when in fact they are the grave markers of what has already stilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its root: vibration. Indifferent, indiscriminate, chaotic. Before narrative, before intention. Just movement through medium, unclaimed by plot or protagonist.  \n",
    "Then resonance: the body’s agreement with vibration. Here, still, no story. Only the body's shiver in sympathetic motion—a trunk rising from the ground of physics, not myth.  \n",
    "Then comes the fork: **consonance** vs. **dissonance**. But not as moral axes. These are not heroes and villains, but intervals. Dissonance is not conflict in the narrative sense—it is *frictional potential*, a wild harmonics hunting for home, not yet resolved. Consonance is the resolution we teach ourselves to crave, but that craving is already an aesthetic judgment retrofitted into a life that was more sus than settled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suspension**—that’s where things get strange. Not a binary. Not a narrative arc. *Sus* is the fractal branching. The emergent geometry of paths not taken, tones unresolved, selves still negotiating. Suspension defers the cadence. It holds the tension without release. It is jazz, not opera. It is Jai Alai, not baseball.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally: **Mode**. The canopy. A tonal ecosystem that permits certain branchings, forbids others. Modes are not stories—they are *environments*. Dorian is not a tale; it is a terrain. The Aeolian is not an arc; it is an atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where narrative truly fails. It pretends to be emergent when it is only interpretive. It is the IPA telling you the story of the troops in India, not the yeast cultures themselves. It is the Jai Alai tribute can, not the ball hurtling at 188mph. Narrative wants to slow it down, give it character development. But the game doesn’t care. The story is brewed after the velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emergent phenomena—like music, like weather, like consciousness—have no room for narrative until long after they’ve moved on. The story arrives late, like a colonial letter. And by then, the resonance has already passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us honor the sus. Let us live in the unresolved. Let the ball fly, and forget the merry name."
