  <h1>Framing the Question</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>What changed between late 2024 and early 2025 for Juan Soto?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the final months of 2024, Juan Soto was protected by Aaron Judge in the Yankees lineup. This protection influenced pitcher behavior—Soto received more hittable pitches because the threat of Judge batting next forced pitchers to engage.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2025, Soto signed with the New York Mets. Without Judge behind him, that protection vanished. The central question of this analysis is:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <em>Did losing lineup protection from Aaron Judge measurably affect Juan Soto’s performance at the plate?</em>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This project analyzes that hypothesis using Statcast data, a rolling average of hits, and side-by-side visual comparison of two temporal segments: 
    Yankees with Judge, and Mets without.
